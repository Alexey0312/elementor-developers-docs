# Editor Work Flow

What happens behind the scene when the user creates a new Elementor page? The work flow lifecycle has four stages: **Loading**, **Editing**, **WordPress Preview** and **Saving**.

## Work Flows

* [Loading](./editor-loading/) - How the Elementor loads the editor.
* [Editing](./editor-editing/) - The processes that occur when editing the page.
* [WordPress Preview](./editor-preview/) - Preview unsaved changes in the frontend.
* [Saving](./editor-saving/) - What happen when Elementor saves the data.
